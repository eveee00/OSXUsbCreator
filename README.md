# Scripts
Just some scrips I made.

- [OSXUSBCreator](https://github.com/eveee00/scripts/blob/main/osx.sh) | Shell script to download and create a OSX 10.7-10.12 installer.
- [FluidsynthLauncher](https://github.com/eveee00/scripts/blob/main/synthlauncher.sh) | Small and simple shell script to launch fluidynth with a soundfont selection. Don't forget to change the soundfont dir in the script if you end up using it.
